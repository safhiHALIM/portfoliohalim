  "I’m an **experienced software developer** passionate about programming and building **smart, user-centric solutions**. I specialize in *Microsoft technologies* with strong expertise in **C#, C, and SQL Server**, but I also thrive in **full-stack web development**—crafting everything from backend APIs to engaging frontend interfaces.",
  "On the **backend**, I build robust services with *Node.js and Express*, design scalable data models with *MongoDB*, and integrate business logic that performs under real-world loads. On the **frontend**, I create *dynamic, responsive user experiences* using **React** (part of the MERN stack) while ensuring seamless interaction between client and server.",
  "Using modern full-stack stacks like **MERN** lets me deliver cohesive applications with a single language across the entire web stack, increasing efficiency and reducing friction. I also have solid experience in **event-driven and object-oriented programming**, desktop apps with *C#/.NET* (ADO.NET, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Xamarin), and advanced analysis/design methods (*UML, MERISE*).",
  "I’m passionate about **efficient, scalable code** that solves real problems—and occasionally makes other developers smile."
